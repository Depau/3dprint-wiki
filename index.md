### Edit an existing page

Just open the page file on GitHub and click the "pencil" icon to edit it.

On the website you will find a "Edit this page on GitHub" button around the bottom of the page.


### Creating a new page

In the wiki folder, click "Add file", "Create new file".

The file name ends up in the URL: it should be something like `page-name.md`, the URL
will be `/wiki/page-name`.

Paste and adjust the following content at the beginning of the file to set the
page layout and the title, then add the content after that.

```yml

layout: default
title: Page title
#parent: Parent title if this is a sub-page, otherwise delete this line
#has_children: true if this page has children, otherwise delete this line

# Page title
```

## Testing the website on your computer

- Install Docker for Linux or macOS (it should work on Windows too but the command needs to be adapted)
- Clone the Git repository to your computer
- Run the website on your computer by running on the terminal:

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```

- The website will be available at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
