This wiki is a FAQ page for our 3D printing group: <i class="fa fa-telegram"></i> [@Print3D_Group](https://t.me/Print3D_Group)

Feel free to add pages or update content, edit the files on GitHub and send a pull request.

The content is licenses under the [Creative Commons CC0 license](https://github.com/Depau/3dprint-wiki/blob/master/LICENSE).

## About this wiki

This wiki aims to be a quick source of information for 3D printer users and in particular our Telegram group.

It does not aim to replace or compete with other great sources of information such as RepRap.org or official documentation websites, but rather be a "quick instruction manual"/FAQ site for the questions that come up most frequently in our Telegram group. For all the details, links to more extensive documentations should be provided.

We also provide a list of suggested printers for different price ranges. Note that if a printer is not listed it doesn't necessarily mean it's crap! Actually, we encourage users to add their own content, and note if a particular model has some well-known flaws (such as the automatic house ignition feature found in the Anet A8).

We do not accept paid referral links on this website or in the printer lists. This is a place for finding information, **no advertisements are allowed**.

## Contributing content

All pages are under the [`/wiki`](https://github.com/Depau/3dprint-wiki/tree/master/wiki) folder.

You should check out the [Kramdown Markdown reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) and the [Just the Docs documentation](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) to
learn how to write markdown pages that work well on the website.

### Edit an existing page

Just open the page file on GitHub and click the "pencil" icon to edit it.

On the website you will find a "Edit this page on GitHub" button around the bottom of the page.


### Creating a new page

In the wiki folder, click "Add file", "Create new file".

The file name ends up in the URL: it should be something like `page-name.md`, the URL
will be `/wiki/page-name`.

Paste and adjust the following content at the beginning of the file to set the
page layout and the title, then add the content after that.

```yml
---
layout: page  # Use page_nocomments for the main category page
title: Page title
#parent: Parent title if this is a sub-page, otherwise delete this line
#has_children: true if this page has children, otherwise delete this line
---

# Page title
```

### Navigation

Adding new categories is not possible on the web-based GitHub interface. You need to use Git on your computer. If you need help you can ask @depauh in the Telegram group to create it for you.

Documentation on the site navigation can be found [here](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/#main-navigation).

### Uploading pictures

To avoid making the repository overly big, just upload them to [postimages.org](https://postimages.org/)

## Testing the website on your computer

- Install Docker for Linux or macOS (it should work on Windows too but the command needs to be adapted)
- Clone the Git repository to your computer
- Run the website on your computer by running on the terminal:

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" -p 4000:4000 -it jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```

- The website will be available at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
