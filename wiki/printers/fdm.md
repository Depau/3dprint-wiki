# 3D printers (FDM/FFF)


Below is a **non-exhaustive** list of printers at various price points that are generally considered great for ther price. However, just because a printer isn't listed here it doesn't mean it's bad.

The printers listed below are FDM printers - i.e. they work with a spool of filament. If you're interested in resin printers, see the [resin printers]({{ site.base_url }}/printers-resin/) page.

*Note: all measurements are in millimeters (mm). All prices are in USD$.*
