# 3D printer technologies

**SLA _(Stereolithography)_**
Lasers and curing or something
_Subnote: DLP (Digital Light Processing) is extremely similar to SLA, except DLP uses a projector to flash an image on the platform, opposed to a laser beam._

**SLS _(Selective Laser Sintering)_**
Lasers and fusing or something


**FDM _(Fused Desposition Modelling)_**
(Sometimes also called FFF - Fused Filament Fabrication) Most enthusiast printers you will encounter are FDM. FDM is a 3D printing method where material is melted layer by layer and fused together.

There are a few motion types that fall under FDM.
