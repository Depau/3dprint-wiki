# 3D printing business/shop FAQ

Want to start a 3D printing business? You think it's gonna be easy? It's not.

Professional grade 3D printing requires time. You need to attend the print at all times to spot potential issues, charge your customers extra to account for electricity, material, cleaning, maintenance, plus all the time spent to reprint models when a print fails.

Most customers will not like your prices, so your mielage my vary. Also, for the prices you *will have* to charge, customers are going to expect perfect prints, fast times. You need to have very good hardware (not shitty chinese kits, $1000+ printers), you need to have spare filaments for every color and material because you don't want your customer to wait for your amazon package to arrive.

If you really want that to be your business, you should definitely go for it, but you need to get good, reliable hardware and be very aware of how your time is spent, how your printer works, how to properly print models of all sorts of shapes and in general of all the difficulties of running an actual business.
